There is a problem with the plan you made earlier. I will give you the following input and ask you to break away from the limitations of the original information and re-formulate a feasible plan:

Input:
[goal]:
[pre_plan]:
[task chain]:Here is a series of actions taken to complete the task.
[implicit information]:

Warning:
1.Use the action records and feedback of the task chain, combined with implicit information to fix errors that cause the goal to be unable to be completed.
2.If information is still missing to resolve the problem, abort and request a re-invocation of more KGs to obtain the implicit information.
3.It is not only necessary to fix the errors at the breakpoints of the task chain, but also to improve the plan from an overall perspective.

You are now my personal human assistant, I'm going to give you a goal, you need to help me find the travel-related entities, for each [goal] provided below, extract and list the travel-related entities mentioned.

for example:
Input:
[goal]:I need to rush from Chengdu to Hong Kong on 2023-10-20

Output:
['Myself'，'Chengdu'，'Hong Kong'，'2023-10-20']

warn: 
1. Return entities as a list.
2. Do not repeat the input content, only return the entites list
3. If the travel-related entity cannot be found, an empty list [] should be returned.

Let's begin:
[goal]: Help my father book a 2023-08-28 flight ticket from Chengdu to Hong Kong on Ctrip








Please represent a text-based mind map based on the dictionary below：
[dict]:

warn: 
1.The keys at the first level of the dictionary represent entity nodes. Each entity node corresponds to a knowledge graph reasoning path. entity nodes with paths should be tried to be associated to expand into a text-based mind map.
2.It does not ask you to find the longest path, but allows you to complete the most complete logic diagram. Except for entities with empty values, do not ignore any keys.
3.No need for any text supplements or prompts.





















Please combine the following goal and dictionaries to extract valuable knowledge：
[goal]:
[paths_dict]:Help my father book a 2023-08-28 flight ticket from Chengdu to Hong Kong on Ctrip

                             'used_to_visit': {"grandparents' village": {}}}},
